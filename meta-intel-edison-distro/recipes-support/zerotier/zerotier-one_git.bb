SUMMARY = "ZeroTier network virtualization service"
DESCRIPTION = "ZeroTier is a smart programmable Ethernet switch for planet Earth. It allows \
all networked devices, VMs, containers, and applications to communicate as if they all reside \
in the same physical data center or cloud region. This is accomplished by combining a \
cryptographically addressed and secure peer to peer network (termed VL1) with an Ethernet \
emulation layer somewhat similar to VXLAN (termed VL2). Our VL2 Ethernet virtualization layer \
includes advanced enterprise SDN features like fine grained access control rules for network \
micro-segmentation and security monitoring. All ZeroTier traffic is encrypted end-to-end using \
secret keys that only you control. Most traffic flows peer to peer, though we offer free (but \
slow) relaying for users who cannot establish peer to peer connections."

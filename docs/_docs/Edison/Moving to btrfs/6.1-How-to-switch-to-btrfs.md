## Automatic conversion
If you don't mind loosing the contents of the `update` and `home` partition you can do this right now. Otherwise backup whatever is there you want to keep, or proceed to [Manual conversion](6.1-How-to-switch-to-btrfs#manual-conversion) and make sure you understand the process.

Otherwise, building as always with `make image` or `bitbake -k edison-image` will now produce `edison-image-edison.btrfs` as well.

This needs some pre-processing before it can be used. If you use `make image` that will be done automatically.
{% include note.html content="The preprocessing currently needs to become root, so at the end of the make process (some hours after issuing the make command) you will be asked for you sudo password. Don't forget to give that." %}

If you build your image using `bitbake -k edison-image`, you can use `make postbuild` or alternatively:

```
meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsSnapshot.py
```
will rearrange so that the image contains `@`, `@modules` and `@home` subvolumes.

It can then be flashed using:
```
./flashall --btrfs
```
{% include warning.html content="This overwrites the existing image, it will be completely replaced, including `@home` which will be lost. If you want to save your home directory, now would be a good time." %}

This will resize the boot partition and discard the `update` and `home` partition. `/home` will be mounted with a subvolume called `@home`. The root's home directory will be on `/root` to prevent boot problems when there is a problem mounting `@home`.

Flashing will take quite a bit longer than you are used to, due to the (Yocto's default) size of the image. Even though all that space is not used.

The good news is, this is probably the last time you will be using `flashall.sh` (unless you horribly break something and want to start over).

After you have the btrfs based image running you can use `btrfsFlashOta.sh`. This [sends a btrfs snapshot](6.2-Transferring-a-new-btrfs-image) (subvolume) to Edison that you can boot separately.

Further `btrfsFlashOta` can [send/update/delete a kernel](6.3-Installing-an-alternate-kernel), [update U-Boot](6.4-Installing-an-updated-U-Boot.html#install-updated-u-boot-over-the-air-ota) and [U-Boot Env](6.4-Installing-an-updated-U-Boot.html#install-updated-u-boot-env-over-the-air-ota). Basically this implements the functionality of flashall.sh without relying on a USB connection.

## Manual conversion
 
This is what we want to accomplish:  
 1. Increase the size of `boot`  
 2. Install rescue image into `boot`  
 3. Add the rescue image to U-Boot boot variables  
 4. Boot into rescue image  
 5. Delete the `update` partition  
 6. Resize `rootfs` to use available space  
 7. Install `btrfs` image into `rootfs`  
 8. Convert `home` `ext4` partition to `btrfs` and take snapshot `@home`  
 9. Btrfs send `@home` snapshot to `rootfs` pool
 10. Delete the `home` partition  
 11. Resize `rootfs` to use all available space  
 12. Rename `rootfs` to `home`
 13. Boot into `home`

The following is intended more to document what's going on in the process then to really do the conversion this way. But if you really want to, you can.

### 1 - 3. Starting point: ext4 Kirkstone image with `btrfs` patches

If you already had this flashed you can skip directory to step 4.
 
Build and `flashall` (but see **Warning** below) as you would normally a version with the btrfs patches. This will:  
 1. Update U-Boot to a `btrfs` enabled version  
 2. Install in the boot partition: `bzImage` and `initrd`. The kernel has `btrfs` enabled and the `initrd` has `ext4` and `btrfs` tools for repair and maintenance. Even though the partition is called `boot` (fat formatted) we will use it as a rescue image only. Currently the size does not exceed 20MiB and should easily fit, but we will take the opportunity to increase the size to 64 MiB to allow it to function as a usb disk when in gadget mode.  
    Expanding `boot` will move the start of `update` partition and make it **unreadable**. 
    {% include warning.html content="Yes, you read that correctly. This operation will destroy your `update` partition `mmcblk0p9`. Before running `flashall` it would be a good idea to double check what is there and salvage it now you still can." %}  
 3. Update the U-Boot environment to enable booting the rescue image.  
This is how your partitions will be redefined:
```
partitions='uuid_disk=${uuid_disk};name=u-boot0,start=1MiB,size=2MiB,uuid=${uuid_uboot0};name=u-boot-env0,size=1MiB,uuid=${uuid_uboot_env0};name=u-boot1,size=2MiB,uuid=${uuid_uboot1};name=u-boot-env1,size=1MiB,uuid=${uuid_uboot_env1};name=factory,size=1MiB,uuid=${uuid_factory};name=panic,size=24MiB,uuid=${uuid_panic};name=boot,size=64MiB,uuid=${uuid_boot};name=rootfs,size=1536MiB,uuid=${uuid_rootfs};name=update,size=704MiB,uuid=${uuid_update};name=home,size=-,uuid=${uuid_home};'
```
Also there will be some new variables in U-Boot:
```
boot_rescue=zboot ${loadaddr} 0x1800000 0x6000000 0x1800000
bootargs_rescue=debugshell=0 tty1 console=ttyS2,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p7 rootfstype=vfat systemd.unit=multi-user.target hardware_id=00
do_rescue=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_common} ${bootargs_rescue}; run load_rescue; run boot_rescue
load_rescue=load mmc 0:7 ${loadaddr} bzImage;load mmc 0:7 0x6000000 initrd
```

If anything goes wrong the Rescue image will have the tools to fix it (in the worst case you can of course always do `flashall --recovery` and start over, but that is a bit tedious isn't it).

To get to Rescue:
```
press <ESC> during boot to enter U-Boot

run do_rescue
```

### 4. Boot into  ext4 Kirkstone image

Rebooting Edison should take you into Kirkstone on mmcblk0p8 (`rootfs`).

The first time it will run the /sbin/post-install.sh script, let it complete.
It may be that the `update` partition has been fat32 formatted earlier, or maybe it's corrupt. If it's fat formatted and you are connected over `usb` this partition maybe mounted on your host (as a gadget), you might want to unmount it now.

Anyhow we are going to delete it in the next step.

### 5 - 6. Rearrange partitions

```
parted /dev/mmcblk0

unit s # show size in sectors
print  # check if all partitions are as in table above

    Model: MMC H4G1d (sd/mmc)
    Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 7634944s
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags: 
    
    Number  Start     End       Size      File system  Name         Flags

     4      12288s    14335s    2048s                  u-boot-env1  msftdata
     5      14336s    16383s    2048s     ext2         factory      msftdata
     6      16384s    65535s    49152s                 panic        msftdata
     7      65536s    196607s   131072s   fat16        boot         msftdata
     8      196608s   3342335s  3145728s  ext4         rootfs       msftdata
     9      3342336s  4849663s  1507328s  fat32        update       msftdata
    10      4849664s  7634910s  2785247s  ext4         home         msftdata

rm 9   # delete update partition !! can not be recovered

resizepart 8 # until 1 sector before start of home (partition 10)
    Warning: Partition /dev/mmcblk0p8 is being used. Are you sure you want to continue?
    Yes/No? yes                                                               
    End?  [3342335s]? 4849663s                                               

quit
```
Now resize the filesystem `rootfs` to make use of the larger partition:
```
/lib/systemd/systemd-growfs /
```
Now you have 1 large `rootfs` and 1 `home` partition.

```
root@edison:~# df

```

### 7. Install `btrfs` image

It is possible to convert the existing `ext4` partition to `btrfs`. But it is much less work to just flash the already built `btrfs` image.
Building with `make image` or `bitbake -k edison-image` produced a `edison-image-edison.btrfs` in addition to `edison-image-edison.ext4`. This needs some pre-processing before it can be used:
```
make postbuild
```
will rearrange so that the image contains `@`, `@modules` and `@home` subvolumes.

The following steps require accessing the Edison using DFU. If you have not followed the instructions in [Avoiding Permissions Issues](1.1-Prerequisites-for-building.html#avoiding-permissions-issues), you will need to invoke `dfu-util` as root with sudo each time.

To flash the Edison Arduino board you need 2 USB connections.

1.  Connect the first USB cable to the USB port marked as 3 in the photograph below.  
    This cable will be your serial connection to the Edison. To connect to the edison you might use a terminal emulator like `gtkterm`. The serial port is probably /dev/ttyUSB0 and the baud rate is 115200 with parity none. If you prefer the command line you can use `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`.

2.  The second cable to attach goes to the USB port marked as 2 in the photograph below.  
    This port is a special port that can act as USB host or USB slave of which only one is active at a time. As you will be connecting to a host port of your PC, it needs to be configured as slave on the Edison. Push the switch down in the direction of the micro USB ports so that the port is enabled.
![Alt tekst](images/Edison-arduino.png)

3.  On Ubuntu you might need to install the package `dfu-util`.

4.  Press the reset button (under the text RESET in the picture above).

5.  In your terminal press the ESC key to interrupt the boot process.

6.  You will probably see:

        U-Boot 2020.04

7.  In your terminal type at the `boot>` prompt:

        run do_force_flash_os

8.  In a second terminal window:
    ```
    dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt rootfs -D edison-image-edison.btrfs
    ```

    This will flash the image to the rootfs partition. In the first terminal window you may watch the flashing to complete.
```
    #  
    DFU complete CRC32: 0xf340088e  
    DOWNLOAD ... OK  
```
    Now flash the btrfs enabled U-Boot environment and it's backup and reboot
```
    dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt u-boot-env0 -D edison-btrfs.bin
    dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt u-boot-env1 -D edison-btrfs.bin -R
```

### 8 - 12. Move `home` to `rootfs/@home`
First we convert `home` to btrfs, then take a snapshot and send it to `rootfs`:
```
mkdir /media/home
btrfs-convert /dev/mmncblk0p10
btrfs scan
mount btrfs -t btrfs /dev/mmncblk0p10 /media/home
btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /media/home /media/home/@home
btrfs send /media/home/@home | btrfs receive /media/rootfs
btrfs property set -ts /media/rootfs/@home ro false
btrfs balance start /media/rootfs # you could skip this, but if you run it let it complete
umount /media/home
umount /media/rootfs
```

Get rid of the `home` partition:
```
parted /dev/mmcblk0

unit s # show size in sectors
print
rm 10  # delete home partition !! can not be recovered
resizepart 8 7634910
```
Rename the `rootfs` partition to `home`
```
name 8 home
quit
```
Mount and resize `home`:
```
mount btrfs -t btrfs /dev/mmncblk0p8 /media/rootfs
btrfs filesystem resize max /media/rootfs
```

### 13. Boot into `home`
```
umount /media/rootfs
```
Resetting the Edison should boot you right into the kernel and initrd located in the `@boot` subvolume on the `home` partition. The root subvolume `@`, will be mounted on `/` and `@boot` on `/boot` after the `switchroot`.

{% include note.html content="We also have a subvolume `@modules` mounted on `/lib/modules`. This will allow us to have a 2nd bootable image `@new` and at the same time multiple kernel versions installed in `@boot`, with their corresponding modules on `@modules`. Each bootable image we can then be booted with either kernel." %}

### Building the SDK

In the same directory as `make setup`:

        make sdk

### Installing the SDK

The SDK consists of an installer that you can install onto multiple machines.

You can install it to any directory you like. However, if you install it to `out/linux64/build/tmp/work/edison-poky-linux/edison-image/1.0-r0` it will be automatically deleted when the image is updated.

It might be convenient to create a link from your work dir to `out/linux64/build/tmp/work/edison-poky-linux/edison-image/1.0-r0/sdk/image/opt/poky-edison/5.0.6/` so you can easily initialize it.

### Using the SDK

The SDK is initialized by running the script:

        source <your work dir>/5.0.6/environment-setup-core2-64-poky-linux

(for 64 bit target)

or

        source <your work dir>/5.0.6/environment-setup-core2-32-poky-linux

(for 32 bit target)

Once you have run this, compiler / linker etc are set to use the cross-compiler to build for the Edison with the Edison's installed libraries in the sysroot.

The effect is you can build on your local host with the same results as building locally on the Edison.

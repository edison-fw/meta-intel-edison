## What's new for this release
 1. Linux make v6.12.3 LTS the default kernel, upgrade U-Boot to v2024.10
    We also provide v6.6.0 (testing) and v6.1.54-rt15 (LTS PREEMPT_RT kernel) for development purposes.
 2. Update to Yocto Scarthgap LTS.
 3. Select libgpiod v2.1.2 and fixed dependents. Note: this is a backwards incompatible change (scarthgap does support v1.6.4).
 4. We have jobserver support! This will make sure that no matter how many compile jobs are started by `bitbake` either via `make` or `ninja` the total number will not exceed the number of cores. This roughly limits RAM memory use to 1GB x #cores.
 5. We have `aptitude`. Aptitude is a front end to `apt` and works as a TUI (via a terminal or ssh) to find and select packages, investigate and resolve broken dependencies.
 6. Updated Debian to `bookworm`. If you are not using Edison as an "edge" device (in terms of IIoT), but more as an always low-power server you might prefer the Debian image which allows you to install Debian pre-built packages.

## Bluetooth attach

{% include note.html content=" On the acpi enabled image this command is no longer needed and has been removed." %}

## Assign the correct Bluetooth address
On Intel Edison the BCM43341B Bluetooth controller has a default MAC address 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC if none
is given. This address contains the sequence 43341B, the name the controller itself. Using the same BD_ADDR is problematic when having multiple Edison modules in each others range and also prevents a BNEP device from being created, needed for BT tethering. Therefore this address is blacklisted in the kernel, which blocks Bluetooth
until a unique BD_ADDR is configured using `btmgmt -i hci0 public-addr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`.

Each Intel Edison stores a unique BD_ADDR in `/factory/bluetooth_address`.

A `systemd` service `/factory/bluetooth_address` is provided that powers on Bluetooth on boot and configures the factory provided address.

## Unblock the Bluetooth device
Bluetooth may be soft blocked. To unblock:
```
connmanctl enable bluetooth
```
Or the old school:
```
root@edison:~# rfkill list

0: phy0: wlan
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
1: hci0: bluetooth
         Soft blocked: yes
         Hard blocked: no
root@edison:~# rfkill unblock 1
root@edison:~# rfkill list
0: phy0: wlan
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
1: hci0: bluetooth
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
```
In case of problems check the logs for the following:
```
dmesg | grep -i blue

## Pair and connect Bluetooth
To connect to other devices use: `bluetoothctl`
```
root@edison:~# systemctl start bluetooth
root@edison:~# bluetoothctl
[NEW] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC edison [default]
Agent registered
[bluetooth]# discoverable on
Changing discoverable on succeeded
[CHG] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC Discoverable: yes
[bluetooth]# pairable on
Changing pairable on succeeded
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34 00-0A-3A-71-BA-34
[bluetooth]# connect 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34
Attempting to connect to 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34
[CHG] Device 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34 Connected: yes
```
and follow the instructions in [Intel Edison Bluetooth Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/edison/sb/edisonbluetooth_331704007.pdf)

Alternatively you might want to connect from the other device (your phone). It that case it might be easier to change the default agent:
```
agent off
agent DisplayOnly
default-agent
agent on
```
{% include note.html content="Alternative agents are KeyboardDisplay, DisplayYesNo." %}

## Serial communication over Bluetooth

I have succeeded in paring 2 BT 4.0 devices and failed in paring a BT 2.0 device. I was able to get a wireless terminal using the following command on the Edison:

    rfcomm watch /dev/rfcomm0 3 /sbin/agetty -L 115200 rfcomm0 xterm-256color

and on the client (laptop):

    sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 ##:##:##:##:##:## 3

    screen /dev/rfcomm0 115200

## Bluetooth tethering
On the other device (phone) enable tethering and connect to the Intel Edison.

In `connmanctl`:
```
connmanctl> services 
* O Wired                gadget_000000000000_usb
    OP35_Extra           wifi_xxxx_xxxxxxx_managed_psk
...
    Ferry Toth (Galaxy Note3) bluetooth_xxxx_xxxx

connect bluetooth_xxxx_xxxx

connmanctl> services 
* O Wired                gadget_000000000000_usb
*   Ferry Toth (Galaxy Note3) bluetooth_xxxx_xxxx
```

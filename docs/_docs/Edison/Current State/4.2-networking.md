## connman

`connman` connects wifi and ethernet (SMSC9514 USB 4p+LAN hub) or ethernet-over-usb (gadget). 

You might need to `systemctl enable connman && systemctl start connman` once.

## Ethernet
SMSC LAN9514 4p usb/ethernet hub works without configuration. But you can turn it off with `connmanctl`.

```
connmanctl
disable ethernet  
```

##  Wifi
It may be soft blocked. To unblock use `connmanctl`.
```
connmanctl
enable wifi
agent on 
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
connect wifi_12345678_123......910_managed_psk
```
and enter your password

The following method to unblock works but I consider this obsolete:
```
root@edison:~# rfkill list

0: phy0: wlan
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
    
root@edison:~# rfkill unblock 0
root@edison:~# rfkill list
0: phy0: wlan
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
```
To unblock wifi and bluetooth simultaneously:
```
    rfkill unblock all
```

## Wifi tethering
The current version of `connmanctl` take care of tethering without the use of `hostapd`. Therefore we removed `hostapd`. Instructions for enabling a wifi access point:
```
connmanctl
enable wifi
tether wifi on <ssid> <passphrase with at least 8 chars>
```
To quickly switch between Access Point and Wifi:
```
ap-mode-toggle start | stop | status | toggle
```
You must have manually setup a tether previously using `connmanctl`, the stored `ssid` and `passphrase` will be used.

##  Gadget
It may be powered off. To power on use `connmanctl`.
```
connmanctl
enable gadget
services
connect gadget_aabbccddeef1_usb
```
To make a shared network you need to configure the host computer. On KDE5/6 (Kubuntu 18.10 - 24.04) create a new connection using Plasma Network Manager:
{% include image.html file="net1.png" alt="Make a new network connection" border="true" max-width="90%" %}
Make this network active only on the shared network device:
{% include image.html file="net2.png" alt="Restrict to Edison only" border="true" max-width="90%" %}
Select shared with other computers:
{% include image.html file="net3.png" alt="Make the connection shared" border="true" max-width="90%" %}
Other network manager based desktops will require similar steps.

You will likely want to run a DNS server on this shared connection. This appears to be simple, install `dnsmasq` on the host and let Network Manager handle it.
```
sudo apt-fet instaldnsmasq

sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```
and put under [main]
```
[main]
dns=dnsmasq
```

## Openvpn
Create a directory `/var/lib/connman-vpn/` containing your myhost.config file. myhost can be whatever you like, the extension must be .config. If you have a working `openvpn` connection (f.i. on your desktop) you already have working certificate files. Place them under `/etc/openvpn/`.

### Sample myhost.config

```
[provider_MyHost]
Type = OpenVPN
Name = MyHost
Host = my.host.com
Domain = office
OpenVPN.CACert = /etc/openvpn/cacert.pem
OpenVPN.Cert = /etc/openvpn/user-certificate.pem
OpenVPN.Key = /etc/openvpn/user-key.pem
OpenVPN.Proto = udp
OpenVPN.CompLZO = yes
```

Then start the `connman-vpn` service:

```
systemctl start connman-vpn && systemctl enable connman-vpn
```

Now, when you start `connmanctl services` your vpn connection should be listed:
```
root@edison:~# connmanctl services
* R MyHost        vpn_my_host_com_office
*AO MyWifi        wifi_..._..._managed_psk
```

## PPP
`ppp` is a way to pass an internet connection across a serial line. The line must be full duplex. If you have 2 Edison-Arduino's you can connect the serial ports together. On Edison-Arduino #1 the Digital header pin 0 (RX) must be tied to pin 1 (TX) of Edison-Arduino #2 and vice versa. I found I need to connect at least 3 GND's to suppress HF interference (my wires are 10 cm long), for this I used pin 14 (GND) on the Digital header and the 2 GND pins on the Power header.

### Setup the serial ports
Currently the UART pins are not correctly setup. This is an open bug in the initrd init script. To setup manually:
```
gpioset `gpiofind TRI_STATE_ALL`=0 && gpioset `gpiofind TRI_STATE_ALL`=1
```
### Test the connection
To test the connection start a terminal on the console on both Edison-Arduino's:
```
screen /dev/ttyS1 2000000
```
Whatever you type into the one Edison-Arduino console will appear on the other.

### Setup ppp
One Edison-Arduino #1 create file `/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1`:
```
noauth
nocrtscts
xonxoff
passive
local
maxfail 0
defaultroute
persist
nodetach
192.168.5.101:192.168.5.100
```
One Edison-Arduino #2 create file `/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1`:
```
noauth
nocrtscts
xonxoff
passive
local
maxfail 0
nodetach
192.168.5.100:192.168.5.101
persist
proxyarp
```

### Prevent DMA from sleeping
We need to prevent the dma controller from entering a sleep state (as waking up can take a long time and cause communication errors, see [HSU](4.4-hsu-i2c-spi.html#hsu). The easiest way to do this without coding is to run `cyclictest` in the background. 

{% include warning.html content="This is an essential step. Without this the serial port will lock up very quickly (seconds) and you will need to reboot to unlock." %}

Run `cyclictest` on both Edison-Arduino's:
```
cyclictest > /dev/null &
```
`cyclictest` sets `/dev/cpu_dma_latency` to 0. You can not simply `echo` 0 to this file as it will return to its original value when `echo` terminate. However, the following will work:
```
exec 3<> /dev/cpu_dma_latency; echo "0xhhhhhhhh_hexadecimal_latency_in_uS" >&3

root@yuna:~# xxd -l 16 -p /dev/cpu_dma_latency
00943577
```
This must be read as 0x77359400 or 2000 sec. (https://blog.csdn.net/msdnchina/article/details/98659435)

### Test the ppp connection
On both Edison-Arduino's start the ppp server:
```
pppd /dev/ttyS1 2000000 &
```
To test the connection, on one Edison-Arduino start iperf3 as a server, on the other as client:
```
iperf3 -s
```
and
```
iperf3 -c 192.168.5.100
```

This will generate output similar to:
```
root@edison:~# iperf3 -c 192.168.5.100

### Setup up routes etc.
You probably want to setup routes etc. Unfortunately doing `ppp` with `connmanctl` and having that take care of setting up conenctions, routes etc. using a NULL modem is not supported currently. You need to do that manually.

MRAA and UPM are libraries that simplify the development of applications that interface with sensors.
Documentation can be found [here](https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/).

{% include warning.html content="Since Honister we have removed MRAA en UPM from the image. The reason is that since the
project moved to the Eclipse Foundation development has slowed down. The latest release 2.2.0 was dated 2020-10-21 although
some commits have been made since then. For a long while nodejs support has been broken. Another reason is that parts of MRAA (in particular gpio) are not functional on Intel Edison since we are using ACPI tables. A substantial rework of intel_edison_fab_c.c would be required and no active participant
in our community is willing to take that up. Nevertheless MRAA and UPM are provided by Yocto and can be installed manually
or added to the image at any time." %}

{% include note.html content="As a modern replacement we have enabled building iio modules in the kernel and installing `libgpiod`, `libiio` and `libserialport`" %}

The following sections are deprecated and kept for historical reason only. You may want to jump to [LibIIO](4.6-libiio) now.


## MRAA
MRAA 2.2.0 is available in Yocto Honister with support for C/C++ and additional packages are built to support python3 and nodejs.

{% include note.html content="These additional packages are not installed by default. You can find these under `out/linux64/build/tmp/work/<arch>-poky-linux/mraa/1.9.0-gitAUTOINC+nnnn-r0/deploy-debs/<arch>/` for manual installation. " type="primary" %}

For manual installation use:

    dpkg -i node-libmraa.deb
    
or

    dpkg -i python3-libmraa.deb

Alternatively, add these packages to edison-image.bb for automatic installation into you image.

### HSU
High speed uart (HSU) works.
### I2C
I2C works see example [below](4.5-mraa-upm.html#example-using-upm-and-mraa-on-the-tsl2561). 
### GPIO
Settings GPIO's works with the non-ACPI image only.

Selecting a pinmux on vanilla linux is supposed to be done by devicetree or ACPI, which has been disabled that in mraa for Linux kernels > 4.0. Currently we have I2C, SPI and HSU selectable configurations available in the form of ACPI tables. For the non-ACPI image, I2C and HSU pinmuxes are preset in the platform code in the kernel. 

## UPM
UPM 2.0 is available in Yocto Honister with support for C/C++ and additional packages are built to support python3 and nodejs.

{% include note.html content="These additional packages are not installed by default. You can find these under `out/linux64/build/tmp/work/<arch>-poky-linux/upm/1.6.0-gitAUTOINC+cc7fec9ae0-r0/deploy-debs/<arch>/` for manual installation. " %}

For manual installation use:

    dpkg -i node-upm.deb
    
or

    dpkg -i python3-upm.deb

Alternatively, add these packages to edison-image.bb for automatic installation into you image.

## Example using UPM and MRAA on the TSL2561
The UPM documentation is very comprehensive, but does not give you a walk through on how to start. In the following we hope to provide step-by-step instructions for a sample sensor, the [TSL2561](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/classupm_1_1_t_s_l2561.html), which is a simple I2C based light sensor.

{% include note.html content="On the ACPI enabled image you need to `modprobe -i i2c-dev` before running any of the code below. On the non-ACPI enabled image, don't forget to run the [I2C script](4.4-hsu-i2c-spi#i2c)" %}

### C example building on the Edison
In the UPM repository you can find the following sample code:

```cpp
//Modified: Abhishek Malik <abhishek.malik@intel.com>

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include "tsl2561.h"

#include "upm_utilities.h"

#define TSL2561_Address 0x39

int main()
{
    tsl2561_context dev = tsl2561_init(6, TSL2561_Address, GAIN_0X, INTEGRATION_TIME1_101MS);
    float abc = 0;
    if(tsl2561_get_lux(dev, &abc) != UPM_SUCCESS){
        printf("ERROR !! ERROR !! ERROR!!");
    }
    printf("value retrieved: %f\n", abc);

    return 0;
}
```
We need to modify the bus to i2c-6 and the address to 0x39 for this example to work.

On Edison build using:

    gcc -I /usr/include/upm/ -lupmc-tsl2561  tsl2561.c

Then run
```
root@edison:~# ./a.out 
value retrieved: 12.000000
```

### Nodejs example on the Edison

On Edison we need to make the tsl2561 module known to node:

    npm install /usr/lib/node_modules/jsupm_tsl2561/

The example code needs similar modification as the C version.

var digitalLightSensor = require('jsupm_tsl2561');

// Instantiate a digital light sensor TSL2561 on I2C
var myDigitalLightSensor = new digitalLightSensor.TSL2561(6, 57, 0, 1);


setInterval(function()
{
	console.log("Light value is " + myDigitalLightSensor.getLux());
}, 1000);

// Print message when exiting
process.on('SIGINT', function()
{
	console.log("Exiting...");
	process.exit(0);
});
```

Then run:

```
root@edison:~# node tsl2561.js
Light value is 4712
Light value is 4715
Light value is 4661
Light value is 3546
Light value is 509
Light value is 208
Light value is 76
Light value is 118
Light value is 3919
```

### Python3 example on Edison
The example code needs similar modification as the C version.

from __future__ import print_function
import time, sys, signal, atexit
from upm import pyupm_tsl2561 as upmTsl2561

def main():
    # Instantiate a digital light sensor TSL2561 on I2C
    myDigitalLightSensor = upmTsl2561.TSL2561(6, 57, 0, 1)

    ## Exit handlers ##

        raise SystemExit

    # This function lets you run code on exit, including functions from myDigitalLightSensor

        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Then run:

```
root@edison:~# python3 tsl2561.py

### C example building with the SDK
You need to [prepare the working directory for the SDK](3-Building-the-SDK). 

After this, put the C source [example](4.5-mraa-upm#c-example-building-on-the-edison) along with a suitable make file.

```
OBJECTS = 

ifdef DEBUG
  OPT_FLAGS= -g -O0
else
  OPT_FLAGS=-O3 -DNDEBUG -flto
endif
INCDIRS = -I=/usr/include/upm/
WARNING_FLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare 
CXXFLAGS+= $(WARNING_FLAGS) $(OPT_FLAGS) $(INCDIRS)
CFLAGS+= $(WARNING_FLAGS) $(OPT_FLAGS) $(INCDIRS)

BINARIES=tsl2561
all: $(BINARIES)

tsl2561: tsl2561.o $(OBJECTS)
	$(CXX) -o $@ $^ $(CXXFLAGS) -lupmc-tsl2561
	
clean:
	$(RM) $(BINARIES) *.o

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ -c $<
	
%.o: %.cc
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $@ -c $<
```

and run `make all`.

The copy `tsl2561` to Edison and:

```
root@edison:~# ./tsl2561
value retrieved: 0.000000
root@edison:~# ./tsl2561
value retrieved: 14.000000
root@edison:~# ./tsl2561
value retrieved: 1523.000000
```

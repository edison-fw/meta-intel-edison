## Configuring the kernel and grab the kernel fragment
Create kernel fragments:
```
bitbake linux-yocto -c kernel_configme -f
bitbake linux-yocto -c menuconfig   // configure the kernel using menuconfig
bitbake linux-yocto -c diffconfig   // create kernel fragment after configuring
```
Go to `out/current/build/tmp/work/edison-poky-linux/linux-yocto/version/` and manually copy the recipe file to `meta-intel-edison/meta-intel-edison-bsp/recipes-kernel/linux/files/`. Then add the fragment to the kernel recipe in `meta-intel-edison/meta-intel-edison-bsp/recipes-kernel/linux/`.

When your done, clean up:

```
bitbake linux-yocto -c cleansstate
```

## Building U-Boot using Yocto
U-Boot is built automatically as part of the image building, see Building and installing the image. The recipe will be provide the latest U-Boot with `acpi` patches provided if required by the kernel (see ACPI or no-ACPI).

## Building U-Boot manually outside of Yocto
{% include note.html content="As Yocto builds U-Boot automatically as written in the section above, it should not be necessary to do this. Instead you probable want to continue to [Flashing everything](2.3-Building-and-flashing-U-boot.html#flashing-everything)" %}
### Background
The following instructions are provided by Andy Shevshenko (0andriy or AShev) on the Edison community pages. They are currently out of date, but provided here for reference purposes. 
He also provides a kernel with patches applied to run on Edison out of the box.

See:

* [https://communities.intel.com/thread/75472](https://communities.intel.com/thread/75472 "vanilla linux") (Intel forum on getting vanilla linux to work on Edison).
* [https://communities.intel.com/thread/107935](https://communities.intel.com/thread/107935 "u-boot") (Intel forum on updating u-boot)

The status is being tracked here: 

* [https://edison-fw.github.io/edison-wiki/vanilla](https://edison-fw.github.io/edison-wiki/vanilla).

### Instructions for building
  * Clone u-boot from [https://github.com/andy-shev/u-boot/tree/edison](https://github.com/andy-shev/u-boot/tree/edison)
  * The current version is edison-v2019.01

        git clone git@github.com:andy-shev/u-boot.git
        cd u-boot
        git checkout edison-v2019.01  

  * To build:

        make clean
        make edison_defconfig
        make -j8

  * If you never updated U-Boot you are still on **v2014.04**. In this case, or if you have **edison-v2016.11**, or **edison-v2017.01** you need to do:

        truncate -s %4096 u-boot.bin

    otherwise skip this step.  
    
## Flashing everything
To flash everything you use either the script `flashall.sh` or the [Intel Flash Tools Lite](https://01.org/node/2463). This replaces U-Boot, the kernel in the boot partition, U-Boot environment and the rootfs.

{% include note.html content="You might be worried that you brick your Edison in some way. [Never say never](0.1-A-word-of-warning), but as long as U-Boot works you can always reflash your device. And if you break U-Boot both flashing tools have a recovery mode that re-flash U-Boot by utilizing the microkernel that loads U-Boot in the first place. See our [Disaster recovery](2.4-Recovery) page for instructions how to do that and for a link to a working binary image." %}


## Flashing only U-Boot
{% include warning.html content="It appears U-Boot must be matched to the IFWI version installed. We have found 2 versions of IFWI. Before continueing read the section [Flashing only IFWI](2.3-Building-and-flashing-U-boot#flashing-only-ifwi) " %}

To flash the Edison Arduino board you need 2 USB connections.

1.  Connect the first USB cable to the USB port marked as 3 in the photograph below.  
    This cable will be your serial connection to the Edison. To connect to the edison you might use a terminal emulator like gtkterm. The serial port is probably /dev/ttyUSB0 and the baud rate is 115200 with parity none. If you prefer the command line you can use `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`.
    
2.  The second cable to attach goes to the USB port marked as 2 in the photograph below.  
    This port is a special port that can act as USB host or USB slave of which only one is active at a time. As you will be connecting to a host port of your PC, it needs to be configured as slave on the Edison. Push the switch down in the direction of the micro USB ports so that the port is enabled.

3.  On Ubuntu you might need to install the package `dfu-util`.
    
4.  Press the reset button (under the text RESET in the picture above).
    
5.  In your terminal press the ESC key to interrupt the boot process.

6.  You will probably see:

        U-Boot 2014.04 (Jun 06 2016 - 14:40:07)

        Don't forget for 2014.04 you need to apply `truncate` as decribed above.

7.  In your terminal type at the `boot>` prompt:

        run do_force_flash_os

8.  In a second terminal window:

        sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt u-boot0 -D u-boot.bin

    This will flash u-boot to the u-boot0 partition. In the first terminal window you may watch the flashing to complete.

        #  
        DFU complete CRC32: 0xf340088e  
        DOWNLOAD ... OK  
        Ctrl+C to exit ...  
        boot > reset  
        resetting ...  

## Flashing only IFWI
You can find out if you need to update IFWI by performing `dmesg | grep OEMB`.
{% include note.html content="This only works if you are still on kernel 3.10.xx. Later kernels don't print out the SFI table versions (including IFWI), not even when you disable ACPI. If you already have an updated kernel and you IFWI version is out of date, you will be experiencing problems with GPIO and as a result with WiFi" %}
If you find `OEMB ifwi version : 237.011` you need to update, with `OEMB ifwi version : 237.015` your are already up to date.

You can manually update IFWI by performing the following commands in addition to step 8 above:

```
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi00 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-00-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib00 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-00-dfu.bin"

sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi01 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-01-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib01 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-01-dfu.bin"
 
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi02 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-02-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib02 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-02-dfu.bin"

sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi03 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-03-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib03 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-03-dfu.bin"
 
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi04 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-04-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib04 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-04-dfu.bin"

sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi05 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-05-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib05 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-05-dfu.bin"
 
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwi06 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-06-dfu.bin"
sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt ifwib06 -D "edison_ifwi-dbg-06-dfu.bin"
```

## Fixing up the u-boot environment
U-boot uses a sort of macro's that you can run after you have interrupted the boot process (see `run do_force_flash_os` above). If you you are manually updating U-Boot, you probably want to run you new built image from the SD card or from USB. In that case you will need to make some changes manually to U-Boot's environment because some keywords changed as well as add some command to boot the image on the SD card.

Inside u-boot you can see this environment by using the command:

        printenv

From when running linux and logged into the Edison you can see the environment using:

        fw_printenv

You can change a line by using `setenv/fw_setenv`. 

*   The following lines need to be changed since the keyword mmc has changed to raw. For example inside u-boot:

```
setenv dfu_alt_info "ifwi${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 1;ifwib${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 2;u-boot0 part 0 1;u-boot-env0 part 0 2;u-boot1 part 0 3;u-boot-env1 part 0 4;boot part 0 7;rootfs part 0 8;update part 0 9;home part 0 10;vmlinuz fat 0 7;initrd fat 0 7"
        
setenv do_dfu_alt_info_ifwi 'setenv dfu_alt_info "ifwi${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 1;ifwib${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 2"'
        
setenv do_dfu_alt_info_mmc 'setenv dfu_alt_info "ifwi${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 1;ifwib${hardware_id} raw 0 8192 mmcpart 2;u-boot0 part 0 1;u-boot-env0 part 0 2;u-boot1 part 0 3;u-boot-env1 part 0 4;boot part 0 7;rootfs part 0 8;update part 0 9;home part 0 10;vmlinuz fat 0 7;initrd fat 0 7"'
```

*   Inside linux replace `setenv` with `fw_setenv`.

*   Inside u-boot you will want to permanently store the above using `saveenv`. Inside linux, the environment is automatically stored.

*   Further on you will like to boot the new kernel. Add the following commands:

        fw_setenv edsboot 'setenv bootargs ${bootargs_edsboot}; run load_edsboot; run boot_edsboot'

        fw_setenv bootargs_edsboot 'tty1 console=ttyS2,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk1 rootfstype=ext4 systemd.unit=multi-user.target hardware_id=00'

        fw_setenv load_edsboot 'load mmc 0:9 0x100000 bzImage-initramfs'

        fw_setenv boot_edsboot 'zboot 0x100000'  

*   When we're done you you be able to boot the new system using the command: `run edsboot`

    The parameters `root` and `rootfstype` tell the initramfs `init` script to mount `mmcblk1` (this should be your sdcard). It will wait for 30 seconds and search for `/sbin/init` on the `rootfs`. If the `rootfs` does not appear or `init` is not found it will mount all partitions possible and then fall back to a prompt for you to investigate the situation. The remaining parameters are passed on to the new `init` (`systemd`).

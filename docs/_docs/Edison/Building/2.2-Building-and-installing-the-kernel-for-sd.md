## Building the kernel

In the past we built a kernel with a built-in `initramfs`. The initramsfs is a cpio built into the kernel containg kernel modules that are needed to boot from SDHC.

This is not longer the case. We now use a separate cpio. The reason is that U-Boot seems not to support loading a kernel larger then 15MB.

Even though we call the file initrd (as everybody seems to be doing), it is really an initramfs.

## Historical reason to use a initrd
According the Andy Shevchenko the kernel modules can not be built into the kernel:
{% include note.html content="Basically either you need to use special initramfs / initrd where you have all necessary modules and you use pivot_root to switch rootfs, or you compile in all those modules. Since one bug(?) in the regulator framework when you built-in sdhci-pci it will prevent to WiFi be enumerated, you have to workaround it [1] like " %}

    echo 0000:00:01.3 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/sdhci-pci/unbind  
    echo 0000:00:01.3 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/sdhci-pci/bind

Instead we chose to use the initramfs. This has the additional advantage that is has a debugshell with `busybox` which will allow you to boot and investigate if your external image is not found or has problems.

## Installing the kernel

We no longer do this manually, although you still can if you want to.

It is far easier to create a complete image with kernel, initrd, the kernel modules and all the rest of the rootfs by following [Building and installing the rootfs to SDHC](2.1-Building-and-installing-the-rootfs)
